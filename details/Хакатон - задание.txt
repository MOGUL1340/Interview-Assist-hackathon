Speaker 1: 
Hey everyone, once again, thanks a lot for joining us today and thanks a lot for taking part in our second wave of Hackathon. As you know, we started with the Idea Challenge and we got 82 ideas. Seven of them got to the final stage and one of them we will discuss today, Paolo, it's yours. And actually it's one of the most popular ideas on today's Hackathon. So, a few words about timeline. Now we are on development stage and we kindly ask you to submit your results by November 10th. Between November 10th and November 20th, we will go through an evaluation stage and our committee may reach you out for a few questions and details. And we will announce the results by the end of November. We also encourage you to use our internal tool, AI Project Factory. But if you need any additional tools or internal infrastructure, you may fill out the form that we will share now in the chat and our IT department will help you with this. And a few words about our evaluation criterias. This time we have three of them, functionality and working demo, customer fit use case depth, and scalability and production potential. You may read about them in more detail than our city corporate experience. hotel in hackathon. And now, Pablo, the mic is yours. Please. present your idea and how you get to this idea.

Speaker 2: 
Okay, thank you very much for the introduction. So I am Pavlo. I am a developer, .NET developer. This is my primary competence, but I also take a position of .NET Guild Lead. I've been working in our company for almost 10 years. and I know many people in the company many people know me I'm not sure if we have already met with you guys but in either case nice to meet you finally I have a chance to be acquainted to you and now I want to present my idea as you can see from its name it is all about the interview presented to the customer. And I don't think it is something new to you, but still, I would like to quickly go through the steps. So first of all, you get the requirements from the customer. It might be in different forms. It might be like a piece of paper with the requirement. It might be some whether the candidate is accepted or not. So you prepare your plan carefully and then you can perform the with the limited time, of course. And what is important here to mention is that the interview, it is not only about the questions. It might be also the code challenge or some simple task for coding because, again, it depends on how customer approaches the staffing for their positions. Please go ahead. Thank you. Here is the simplified schema I tried to draw for you guys. Hopefully it will be more helpful for you rather simply text describing the idea. And here we have, as always, three parts on this schema, the input to the left, the tool, this tool, you actually are supposed to design, to create, to implement this tool or adjut, whatever it is. And finally, to the right, we have output. parts that are more important. those that are less important. So coming to the input, as I have already mentioned we have candidate CV, we have the meeting outcome, I mean the outcome of the meeting with the customer, the outcome might be like a script or a recording and CV is most probably just plain text in different format with some pictures perhaps, so it might There is no structure for that CV format. We also have the job requirements. This is the document that we, to this stage, we have prepared with the customer, with your colleagues perhaps, or with the recruitment office. of course the time because we cannot cover all those topics there and the output then we like ingest all that all that stuff into this tool that is going to be developed and the output would be actually the plan for the interviewer the plan for the interview it might be a spreadsheet for during this hackathon should be able to produce some kind of, let's say, reliable, or I don't know, really want code for the interview. As you see, I put that piece of output like an optional one, but it would be really great if it can produce that we can approach the candidate with during the interview. it about the idea I think, right? the last slide correct yep we can proceed with the questions yes so first before we proceed to the questions i want to wish you good luck and i would say that regardless of the result of the hackathon if you produce something i'm sure that you produce some valuable tool please share it of something like more extensive, I don't know, more user friendly, more advanced, etc. So thank you very much for Good luck again and any question, I would be more than happy to answer them. Yes, Anton, please. Hello, thank you for the presentation.

Speaker 3: 
question about it. So did I understand correctly you want an interview?

Speaker 2: 
every and each role in the company, not for devs only, correct? You know, if you ask me, yes, of course, I want, first of all, for my stack, for my, let's say, competence. But my idea was that if you have some competence metrics and that metrics is grounded to the specific domain, management or I don't know, quality assurance, because unfortunately, I'm not very good in those, like, in those fields. So for me, first of all, of course, it is it is programming and if we narrow it even more so

Speaker 3: 
in the .NET domain. - Okay. - Yeah. - Do you want an ability to download or not download different type of documents in this assistant and work with them somehow.

Speaker 2: 
Yes, because I cannot imagine how... how we can proceed other ways. Copy-paste. - Ah, you mean manually? - Yeah.

Speaker 3: 
You can copy past, copy from the document. passed in the child's

Speaker 2: 
you upload the document and ask questions about this document. Okay, then we can proceed the following way. When you are implementing this tool, you can create some kind of a formalized form and those forms might be in like manually and then we will upload them to the tool. Because honestly, my idea was to get rid of the manual work as as much as we can. I consider this tool as something that will reduce my time for the preparation and in the same time create something unbiased because you know like potentially I believe it is in our nature when you see the list of topic you subconsciously you know try to pick those ones that you know the best I think we can consider some like semi-automated tool, at least for the needs of the hackathon. Okay. What is the most

Speaker 3: 
features, if many, for you.

Speaker 2: 
interview assistant? The most valuable one is the plan of the interview. And this plan should be not just in a form a sequence of question, but it would be really great if it is like some form probably in or something similar where you can also pick your marks for each topic, for each point, for each bullet that was in that plan, the tool and selecting those marks, you have some summary of the

Speaker 3: 
Do you want this assistant to be present on the screen during the interview? No, I think the form would be enough, the result.

Speaker 2: 
product the product of this tool is the form and that form i can use during the interview to put those marks and afterward i can review my marks or have some summary like i don't know it is another question how to summarize those marks which like which weight more which weight less depending on with the topics and the place where the control

Speaker 4: 
good.

Speaker 1: 
No questions anymore. form if you need Do you have any more questions? I guess not. Thanks a lot. Thank you, Pablo. Thank you. presentation and idea discussion.

Speaker 5: 
So, Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
